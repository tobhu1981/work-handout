## Leerzeile am Dateiende

Habe dazu folgendes im Netz gefunden:

GCC (and many C/C++ compilers/tools) warns when a source file does not end with a newline because the C standard and many text-processing tools treat source files as sequences of lines that each end with a newline character. The warning is a consequence of three practical and historical reasons:

Language grammar and standards
- The C standard defines a source file as a sequence of lines, each ending in a newline character. Some lexical rules (for example, how the preprocessor concatenates lines with backslash-newline, or how tokens are recognized) assume that the final line also terminates with a newline.
- Absence of a terminating newline makes the last line a partial line by that definition, which is technically nonconforming and can alter preprocessing/tokenization behavior in edge cases.
Portability and toolchain expectations
- Many UNIX tools (diff, patch, compilers, editors, version control systems) expect newline-terminated lines. Tools may display warnings like “No newline at end of file” because some operations (patch generation, concatenation) can behave unexpectedly without the final newline.
- Version-control diffs become noisier or confusing when some files lack the final newline, making patches harder to read or apply.
Practical parsing and concatenation issues
- When two files are concatenated (or when header files are included) without a trailing newline, the last token of the first file can be stuck to the first token of the next file, producing valid-but-different tokens (or syntax errors).
- Macros and line-splicing that rely on backslash-newline at the end of a line can misbehave if the termination is missing.

What the warning means in practice

It is usually harmless for well-formed code but points to a nonconforming edge case and a potential source of subtle bugs or toolchain friction.
Fixing it is trivial: add a single newline character at the end of the file. Most editors have a setting to ensure files are saved with a trailing newline automatically.

When it matters

Critical when generating code, writing tools that concatenate files, creating patches, or aiming for strict standards conformance.
Less critical for immediate compilation of small programs, but useful as a hygiene rule for collaborative projects and portable code.

Summary
GCC warns to encourage standards-conforming, tool-friendly files: ending every source file with a newline prevents subtle tokenization, preprocessing, and tooling problems and keeps diffs and patches clean.
